Getting lab 3 to compile is pretty tricky since GTK requires a lot of packages and includes and stuff.
Here's a short explanation of how I got it to work for me.

First of all, it turns out there are many ways to find which packages and directories are required for
a certain library to compile properly. Some of these ways are, handily enough, available within CMake.

The first line we need to add is:
  find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
This line initializes a package manager within CMake which we will then use to find required files for GTK.

That package manager is used in the very next line to add:
  pkg_check_modules(GTK REQUIRED gtk+-3.0)
This line does A LOT of work for us. Basically, we tell CMake to find out which packages and directories
are needed (as the keyword REQUIRED suggests) to compile our project with the library "gtk+-3.0". CMake
then creates variables for us, named along the lines of "<package name>_INCLUDE_DIRS" where <package name>
is the "GTK" we specified at the start of the command.

These variables are immediately put to use by the following two commands:
  target_include_directories(<executable name> PUBLIC ${GTK_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  target_link_libraries(<executable name> ${GTK_LIBRARIES})
Where <executable name> is the name of the compile target you should already have, created by
add_executable somewhere within your CMakeLists.txt file.

And... that's it! That's all you need. Probably. I got mine to compile this way and hopefully you will too!
